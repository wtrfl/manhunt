# Minecraft Manhunt
Minecraft Manhunt is a minigame where one player tries to beat the game, while up to 4* others try and stop them. This plugin is almost identical plugin to the one Dream uses.

(This is only recommended. You can play with as many players as you want. 1-4 is just the most fun.)

## Usage
/manhunt arg1
arg1 being the username of the player you want to HUNT, not be a HUNTER.
